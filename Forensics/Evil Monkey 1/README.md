# Evil Monkey 1

One of the employees at our studio "Meatball Works" sent out this blend file to an external company for review and lighting reworks. When it came back, our EDR system captured malicious traffic that seemed to be coming from Blender. One of the SOC analysts found some sort of encrypted shellcode in the file but doesn't know the encryption key. Can you find it?
Flag should be in the format PCTF{decryption_key}

## Difficulty: 4/10

## Flag: PCTF{Th3_EV!L_M0NK3Y!}

## Hints:
As a wise dev once said "Opening a file with Blender should be considered like opening a file with the Python interpreter"
